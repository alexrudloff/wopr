# Message types

WOPR uses one message format in session files, and in JSON and RPC events. This page defines the messages and the content blocks inside them.

Every message has a `role` field that names its type. A message `timestamp` is a Unix time in milliseconds. Session entries use ISO 8601 timestamps instead. See [session file format](session-format.md).

The Go definitions live in two packages:

- `github.com/alexrudloff/wopr/ai` defines the content blocks, `Usage`, and the provider-facing messages.
- `github.com/alexrudloff/wopr/agent` defines `AgentMessage`, the message type that sessions and events carry.

## Content blocks

A content block has a `type` field. WOPR knows four block types.

### Text

```json
{"type":"text","text":"The tests pass."}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | string | The text. |
| `textSignature` | string, optional | Provider metadata. Pass it through unchanged. |

Go type: `ai.TextContent`.

### Image

```json
{"type":"image","data":"iVBORw0KGgo...","mimeType":"image/png"}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `data` | string | The image bytes, base64-encoded. |
| `mimeType` | string | The media type, such as `image/png` or `image/jpeg`. |

Go type: `ai.ImageContent`.

### Thinking

```json
{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The failing test reads a stale fixture.","thinkingSignature":"..."}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `thinking` | string | The model's visible reasoning. |
| `thinkingSignature` | string, optional | Provider data that lets WOPR send the block back later. Pass it through unchanged. |
| `redacted` | boolean, optional | `true` when the provider hid the reasoning. The text can then be empty while the signature holds encrypted data. |

Go type: `ai.ThinkingContent`.

### Tool call

```json
{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_1","name":"read","arguments":{"path":"README.md"}}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | The call ID. The matching tool result repeats it. |
| `name` | string | The tool name. |
| `arguments` | object | The tool arguments. |
| `thoughtSignature` | string, optional | Provider data. Pass it through unchanged. |
| `namespace` | string, optional | The OpenAI Responses namespace of a namespaced tool. |

Go type: `ai.ToolCall`.

## Usage

Assistant messages always carry `usage`. A tool result carries `usage` only when the tool made its own model calls.

```json
{"input":1200,"output":340,"cacheRead":800,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":2340,"cost":{"input":0.0012,"output":0.0034,"cacheRead":0.0002,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0048}}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | number | Input tokens. |
| `output` | number | Output tokens. |
| `cacheRead` | number | Tokens read from the prompt cache. |
| `cacheWrite` | number | Tokens written to the prompt cache. |
| `cacheWrite1h` | number, optional | The part of `cacheWrite` stored with one-hour retention. |
| `reasoning` | number, optional | Reasoning tokens. They are already part of `output`, so do not add them again. |
| `totalTokens` | number | Total tokens. |
| `cost` | object | Cost of `input`, `output`, `cacheRead` and `cacheWrite`, and the `total`. |

Tool-result usage counts toward session statistics. It is not part of the usage of the main model call.

Go type: `ai.Usage`.

## Model messages

These four roles are the messages a provider understands.

### System message

A system message sets the instructions and the tool set from its position in the transcript onward.

```json
{"role":"system","content":"","sections":{"preamble":"You are an expert coding assistant..."},"timestamp":1768485600000}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `content` | string or text blocks | Instruction text. |
| `sections` | object, optional | Named prompt sections in order. A later message replaces a section by name. A `null` value removes the section. |
| `toolsAdded` | array, optional | Full definitions of tools that become available here. |
| `toolsRemoved` | array, optional | `{"name": ...}` references to tools that stop being available here. |

The first system message declares the starting prompt and tools. Replay the later ones in order to get the current state.

Go type: `ai.SystemMessage`.

### User message

```json
{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Fix the failing test."}],"timestamp":1768485601000}
```

`content` holds text and image blocks. WOPR also accepts a plain string when it reads a message, and it turns the string into one text block. It always writes an array.

Go type: `agent.UserMessage`, or `ai.UserMessage` for a provider request.

### Assistant message

```json
{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Done."}],"api":"openai-responses","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-5","usage":{"input":1200,"output":340,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":1540,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1768485605000}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `content` | array | Text, thinking and tool-call blocks. |
| `api` | string | The provider API that produced the message. |
| `provider` | string | The provider name. |
| `model` | string | The requested model ID. |
| `responseModel` | string, optional | The model the provider reports, when it differs from `model`. |
| `responseId` | string, optional | The provider's response ID. |
| `providerThinkingLevel` | string, optional | The thinking level the provider applied. |
| `diagnostics` | array, optional | Runtime diagnostics, each with `type`, `timestamp`, and an optional `error` and `details`. |
| `usage` | object | See [Usage](#usage). |
| `stopReason` | string | Why the response ended. See below. |
| `deferred` | object, optional | A handle for a response that the provider finishes later. |
| `errorMessage` | string, optional | The error text when `stopReason` is `error` or `aborted`. |
| `rawStopReason` | string, optional | The provider's own stop reason. |
| `endTurn` | boolean, optional | Whether the provider marked the end of its turn. |

`stopReason` is one of these values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | The message is still streaming. |
| `stop` | The model finished. |
| `length` | The model reached its output limit. |
| `toolUse` | The model called one or more tools. |
| `error` | The request failed. |
| `aborted` | The run was stopped. |
| `deferred` | The provider will finish the response later. |

A `deferred` handle has `provider`, `modelId`, `api` and `id`, and optionally `expiresAt`, `pollAfterMs` and `data`.

Go type: `agent.AssistantMessage`, or `ai.AssistantMessage` for a provider request.

### Tool result

```json
{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"call_1","toolName":"read","content":[{"type":"text","text":"# Project"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1768485603000}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `toolCallId` | string | The `id` of the tool call. |
| `toolName` | string | The tool name. |
| `content` | array | Text and image blocks that the model sees. |
| `details` | any, optional | Tool-specific data for renderers. The model does not see it. |
| `usage` | object, optional | Model usage of the tool itself. |
| `isError` | boolean | Whether the tool failed. |

Go type: `agent.ToolResultMessage`.

## Coding agent messages

WOPR adds four roles for the coding agent. Before a model request, WOPR turns each of them into user-role text, with the exceptions that this section names.

### Shell execution

WOPR records a shell command that you run with `!` or `!!`, or through the RPC `bash` command. It is not a tool result.

```json
{"role":"bashExecution","command":"go test ./...","output":"ok ...","exitCode":0,"cancelled":false,"truncated":false,"timestamp":1768485610000}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | string | The command as typed. |
| `output` | string | The combined output. |
| `exitCode` | number | The exit status. |
| `cancelled` | boolean | Whether the command was stopped. |
| `truncated` | boolean | Whether WOPR shortened the output. |
| `fullOutputPath` | string, optional | The file that holds the full output when WOPR shortened it. |
| `excludeFromContext` | boolean, optional | `true` for `!!` commands. WOPR does not send them to the model. |

### Custom message

WOPR creates a custom message for built-in features such as `/goal` updates and background task results.

```json
{"role":"custom","customType":"review-note","content":"Check the error path.","display":true,"timestamp":1768485620000}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `customType` | string | A namespaced name for the message kind. |
| `content` | string or array | The text, or text and image blocks. |
| `display` | boolean | Whether the terminal UI shows the message. |
| `details` | any, optional | Feature-specific data. The model does not see it. |

WOPR sends a custom message to the model when its `content` is a string. WOPR leaves a custom message whose `content` is an array of blocks out of the model request.

### Branch summary

```json
{"role":"branchSummary","summary":"Tried a cache fix; it did not help.","fromId":"e5f6a7b8","timestamp":1768485630000}
```

WOPR builds this message from a `branch_summary` session entry. `fromId` is the entry the branch started from, or `null`.

### Compaction summary

```json
{"role":"compactionSummary","summary":"## Goal\n...","tokensBefore":50000,"timestamp":1768485640000}
```

WOPR builds this message from a `compaction` session entry. `tokensBefore` is the context size before compaction. See [compaction](compaction.md).

## AgentMessage in Go

`agent.AgentMessage` holds exactly one message. It has one pointer field per model role and a map for every other role:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `System *ai.SystemMessage` | `system` |
| `User *agent.UserMessage` | `user` |
| `Assistant *agent.AssistantMessage` | `assistant` |
| `ToolResult *agent.ToolResultMessage` | `toolResult` |
| `Custom map[string]any` | `bashExecution`, `custom`, `branchSummary`, `compactionSummary`, and any other role |

`Role()` returns the role string. `MarshalJSON` and `UnmarshalJSON` read and write the flat JSON shapes on this page. A message with an unknown role decodes into `Custom`, so code that reads messages from an extended host keeps working. The constants `agent.RoleBashExecution`, `agent.RoleCustom`, `agent.RoleBranchSummary` and `agent.RoleCompactionSummary` name the coding agent roles.
