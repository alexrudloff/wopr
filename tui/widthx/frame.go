// FrameAt returns the rows of a pre-rendered component frame for painting at
// width. frameWidth is the width the frame was rendered at; 0 means the
// producer did not report one, and the rows are painted as rendered (an
// over-wide row then reaches the renderer's overflow check).
//
// A frame rendered for any other width is stale and is never painted,
// whatever its rows contain: components always render at the current width.
// The caller has already requested a frame at the current width.
