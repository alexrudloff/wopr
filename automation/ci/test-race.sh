# Race + leak regression gate for the interactive TUI concurrency model.
#
# The interactive TUI runs one main loop that owns all component-tree mutation
# and rendering. Background goroutines must route UI work onto that loop
# (runOnMain for must-not-lose state, postUITask for cosmetic updates) instead
# of touching the tree from their own goroutine. These tests lock that
# invariant in so a future off-loop UI touch fails the build rather than
# shipping a latent data race.
#
#   1. -race regressions: the runOnMain delivery/shutdown proofs (testing/synctest)
#      and the StatusLine + SIGWINCH no-race regressions. TestConcurrent_SIGWINCHVsTyping
#      is intentionally excluded: it is the red oracle that documents the raw
#      off-loop pattern still races, gated behind WOPR_PROBE_RENDER_RACE=1.
#   2. goroutineleak: Go 1.27's profile asserts runOnMain leaves zero
#      goroutines blocked on uiTaskCh after its workload.
