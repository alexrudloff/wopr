// QueueOrderable is an optional interface a tool may implement so the

// order to goroutine-arrival order.

// Parallel calls should register in the mutation queue in tool-call order:
// call N's registration, which chains it onto whatever is currently in the
// per-path map, should complete before call N+1's, even though the calls
// then run concurrently. Per-call goroutines (executeToolCallsParallel) give
// no such guarantee: nothing stops goroutine N+1 from reaching the queue
// before goroutine N. ReserveMutationOrder lets the dispatcher perform that
// registration step itself, synchronously, in its own call-ordered loop,
// closing that gap.
//
// ReserveMutationOrder returns ok=false when the call will not reach the
// queue at all (a tool implementing this must return exactly the same
// ok/no-ok decision its Execute would reach, or a reservation could be left
// registered but never released). The returned params are the same
// (possibly ArgumentPreparer-normalized) arguments Execute receives.
